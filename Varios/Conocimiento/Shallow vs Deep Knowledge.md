> Learning is not supposed to be fun. It doesn't have to be actively not fun either, but the primary feeling should be that of effort. It should look a lot less like that "10 minute full body" workout from your local digital media creator and a lot more like a serious session at the gym. You want the mental equivalent of sweating. It's not that the quickie doesn't do anything, it's just that it is wildly suboptimal if you actually care to learn.


*Andy Matuschak, On sitting down to study independently*  :
> So these learners often feel like they’re failing. They’re making progress too slowly, or else they try to read at their usual pace and then feel like they can’t understand anything. This creates a sense of futility and doom. But it’s an unnecessary sense of futility and doom. Modern information culture may make this worse: we’re constantly receiving the message that anything can be learned in a twenty minute video or a short blog post. Slowing down doesn’t pose any practical problem. If the learner works steadily, they’ll make plenty of progress. But the sense of effort, of really grappling with each page, is often unfamiliar and scary.

> _You cannot read mathematics the way you read a novel. If you zip through a page in less than an hour, you are probably going too fast. When you encounter the phrase “as you should verify”, you should indeed do the verification, which will usually require some writing on your part. When steps are left out, you need to supply the missing pieces. You should ponder and internalize each definition. For each theorem, you should seek examples to show why each hypothesis is necessary. Discussions with other students should help._

Origen en [Current Software Engineers have no Deep Knowledge (Jonathan Blow)](Jonathan%20Blow)) Hay mucho contenido que es vacio en sí pero que siempre esta trending. En el caso del web development:  _mira este nuevo framework de javascript_, _mira este nueva libreria_. Llama mucho más la atención por el clickbait, a comparación de un articulo que se llame [Teach Yourself Programming in 10 Years](https://norvig.com/21-days.html)


[Donald Knuth dice que si algo es popular](https://youtu.be/75Ju0eM5T2c), hay algo mal:

> (...)don't just believe that because something is trendy, that it's good. I'd probably go the other extreme where if... if something... if I find too many people adopting a certain idea I'd probably think it's wrong or if, you know, if... if my work had become too popular I probably would think I had to change.
