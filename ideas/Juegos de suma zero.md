> In Game Theory, zero-sum games is a situation that involves two sides, where the result is an advantage for one side and an equivalent loss for the other. In other words, player one's gain is equivalent to player two's loss, with the result that the net improvement in benefit of the game is zero.


Asume que hay 2 jugadores, para que una gane la otra tiene que perder. La envidia es un juego de suma zero[^1]. Si no puedo, tÃº no puedes tenerlo.

> (...) In a world without growth everything becomes a zero sum game, I only get ahead  by you falling further behind, and that becomes a much nastier world.
