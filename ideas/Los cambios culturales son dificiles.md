> When people are bad at math, they know it, because they get the wrong answers on tests. But when people are bad at open-mindedness they don't know it. In fact they tend to think the opposite. (Paul Graham, What You Can't Say)[^1]


No todos estan dispuestos a cambiar. Especialmente los cambios que son drasticos.

El director de la pelicula El Padrino, Francis Ford Coppola  peleó con Paramount[^2]:

>Paramount never wanted to work with Brando, but Coppola wanted him from the beginning. They wanted the film to be set in the 70s, with hippies, to be current, cheap, and attractive to audiences. Coppola fought for a period piece. These are just two of the major fights fought and won over the course of _The Godfather_'s journey. Your fight may not be for Brando, and you may not even be right every time, but having faith in your gut is as important as any learned skill. If you're writing an original screenplay, as opposed to an adaptation, compromises may pop up in other places, like in terms of budget or marketability. Of course, films are collaborative and flexibility is necessary, but when you truly believe a decision is right for your film, don't back down.


Cuando la gente esta acostumbrada a una verdad, y tratas de desafiarla

[Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)) en [What You Can't Say](https://paulgraham.com/say.html) menciona:

> The prohibition will be strongest when the group is nervous. The irony of Galileo's situation was that he got in trouble for repeating Copernicus's ideas. Copernicus himself didn't. In fact, Copernicus was a canon of a cathedral, and dedicated his book to the pope. But by Galileo's time the church was in the throes of the Counter-Reformation and was much more worried about unorthodox ideas.
