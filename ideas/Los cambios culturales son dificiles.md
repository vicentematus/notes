> When people are bad at math, they know it, because they get the wrong answers on tests. But when people are bad at open-mindedness they don't know it. In fact they tend to think the opposite. (Paul Graham, What You Can't Say)[^1]


No todos estan dispuestos a cambiar. Especialmente los cambios que son drasticos

Cuando la gente esta acostumbrada a una verdad, y tratas de desafiarla

[Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)) en [What You Can't Say](https://paulgraham.com/say.html) menciona:

> The prohibition will be strongest when the group is nervous. The irony of Galileo's situation was that he got in trouble for repeating Copernicus's ideas. Copernicus himself didn't. In fact, Copernicus was a canon of a cathedral, and dedicated his book to the pope. But by Galileo's time the church was in the throes of the Counter-Reformation and was much more worried about unorthodox ideas.
